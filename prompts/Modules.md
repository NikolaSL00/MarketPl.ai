The whole idea is “The idea is to build a personal investment strategy backtesting application that helps users evaluate how different investment strategies would have performed using historical market data.

You will create a modern desktop or web application that enables users to import historical price data from CSV files, configure investment strategies, simulate portfolio evolution, and analyze both return and risk metrics through clear.”  
  
Lets start from the very first feature - import 'User should be able to Import historical asset price data from CSV files. The data should be organized in tables so we can later play with the data. The csv data should be organized and stored in the BE database. There should be no limit for the csv file.' The csv file will follow the following structure "Symbol,Security Name,Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Adj Close,Volume

The backend must use a non-relational database, so we can setup it also here.The queries seems to be slow - add some indexes so the queries can be optimized.

**Now we should procede with the next feature. We want the user to be able to "Select a time range for analysis and Choose and configure an investment strategy". After that functionality we will be able to run a backtest simulation and observe the portfolio value over time. But for now - lets concentrete over "Select a time range for analysis and Choose and configure an investment strategy"Now lets continue with the next features**  
**"Run a backtest simulation**  
**View portfolio value over time**  
**Analyze performance and risk metrics"which will extend the current Configuration page and run the Backtest**I want to make the strategies comparable. In order to do this I want an estimate for example when Dollar-Cost-Averaging to see how many months are there in the period of the selected symbol somewhere in the configurationNow it is time for the next features

Option to compare multiple strategies on the same dataset, same money capital, same date interval  
Visualize results using charts  
Export backtest results
